### FIRST EXAMPLE:

# From http://www.maths.bath.ac.uk/~jjf23/mixchange/split.html

# We have eight agricultural fields (largest "plots" in the design), and each one is assigned to an irrigation
# method (so Irrigation is a factor with 4 levels), so that each irrigation factor will be practiced in two
# different fields. Each field is further split in two, and a "variety" of two types of seed (v1 and v2) will be
# planted in each half. So variety and irrigation are fixed effects, and the field is a random effect.

# Loading data and libraries:

library(lme4)
library(faraway)
library(ggplot2)
head(irrigation)
ggplot(irrigation, aes(y=yield, x=field, shape=variety, color=irrigation)) + geom_point()

# ANOVA(aov) approach:
fit_aov <- aov(yield ~ irrigation * variety + Error(field), irrigation)
summary(lmod)
print(model.tables(fit_aov,"means"),digits=3) 

#lmer approach:
fit_me <- lmer(yield ~ irrigation * variety + (1|field), data = irrigation)
print(summary(fit_me), correlation=FALSE)
anova(fit_me)
confint(fit_me)

#nlme:
library(nlme)
fit_lme <- lme(yield ~ irrigation*variety, random=~1|field, irrigation)
summary(fit_lme); anova(fit_lme)




### SECOND EXAMPLE:

# More complex case with also yield as the DV (continuous), but with 4 "block" parcels of land, divided in eighteen
# fractions; nine of them irrigated and nine not irrigated (so now irrigation is a binary yes/no). Three in 
# each irrigation/no_irrigation case subplots are assigned to "density" of seed (low, medium, high), and 
# for the smallest (highest replication) plot, each density piece will go to fertilizer (N, P or NP).

library(gsheet)
splityield <- read.csv(text = 
    gsheet2text('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1THGClMt_bkP4lYIWqpI3S5mg0uRlGLrP48aVTTIvnX4/edit?usp=sharing',
    format ='csv'))
head(splityield)
summary(splityield)
str(splityield)


#ANOVA (aov) approach:

# From The R Book Michael J Crawley: The model formula is specified as a factorial, using the asterisk notation.
# the error structure is defined in the ERROR term, with the plot sizes  (4 fields (blocks) are the largest plots, 
# followed by their split in half each either irrigated tor not, and followed by three divisions (even smaller
# plots for low, medium or high denisty), and again followed by three divisions for fertilizer (N, P, or NP) - 
# this last being the smallest plot size with the highest replication).  
# The error terms are listed from left to right, from largest to smallest, separated by / . 
# NOTE: the smallest plot size (fertilizer - smallest plot) does not appear in the ERROR term:

fit_aov <- aov(yield ~ irrigation * density * fertilizer + 
              Error(block/irrigation/density), splityield)
summary(fit_aov)

# There are 4 ANOVA tables, one for each plot size:
# The non-significant main effect for density (p = 0.0532) doesn't mean
# density is unimportant because it is a significant interaction with irrigation.

# Understanding interactions:

attach(splityield)
interaction.plot(fertilizer, irrigation, yield)
interaction.plot(density, irrigation, yield)


#lmer approach:
fita <- lmer(yield ~ irrigation * density * fertilizer + (1|block/irrigation/density), data = splityield)
summary(fita, correlation = F)
anova(fita)
confint(fita)

#... and without interactions:

fit_noin <- lmer(yield ~ irrigation + density + fertilizer + (1|block/irrigation/density), data = splityield)
summary(fit_noin, correlation = F)
anova(fit_noin)
confint(fit_noin)

library(pbkrtest)
KRmodcomp(fita, fit_noin)

#nlme:

library(nlme)
fita1 <- lme(yield ~ irrigation * density * fertilizer, 
             random=~1|block/irrigation/density, splityield)
summary(fita1); anova(fita1)
